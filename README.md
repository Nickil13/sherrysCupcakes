## Technologies Used
- HTML

## My process
I wanted to create a basic website to reinforce my knowledge of basic HTML, CSS and JS and to practice my design skills.

## What I learned
In addition to learning how to better structure a multi-page website, I learned how to use CSS grid and got a better idea of where to use a grid display versus flex. I also familiarized myself with using javascript outside of a React framework, such as iterating over a JSON file.
