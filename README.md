## My process
I wanted to create a basic website to reinforce my knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## What I learned
In addition to learning how to better structure a multi-page website, I learned how to use CSS grid and got a better idea of where to use a grid display versus flex. I also familiarized myself with using javascript outside of a React framework, such as iterating over a JSON file.

One thing I would change for my next project is having the design laid out beforehand.
